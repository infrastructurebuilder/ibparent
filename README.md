# ibparent
JVM parent for InfrastructureBuilder

## Purpose

This parent is meant to be a unifying version and config parent for IB projects.  It configures most of the
necessary plugins and manages most of the relevant dependencies for dealing with our internal projects as well
as giving us a platform for keeping those up to date.

## Changes

This parent releases regularly.  Usually, this means every 2 weeks or so, but might mean more frequently if
many things are changing or there is a security concern.  It also might mean that this happens less frequently
than that.

### Proposed Changes

If you're using this parent, or any of it's associated other parents, and you're displeased with the
dependencies that it manages or how that works, then feel free to suggest a change or submit a PR.  Your suggestion
will be given consideration.  However, that does not mean that it will be used.  If that makes your
situation untenable with regard to this, or any other IB project, feel free to fork and update.
